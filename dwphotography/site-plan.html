      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My name is Diana White. I am an Argentine photographer, artist and a student of Web Design and Development. 
        I capture images with meaning, natural views, and the surroundings of every place where I travel. I only highlight the real beauty of these photos. 
        This helps people to ponder about the world and the art that surrounds us in the most realistic way. At the end of my work, I make sure that I have	 accomplished the best result.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is going to be people from 18 and up. Women and men, single and married. Demographically, I am thinking worldwide audience. People who are looking for inspiring images for their life or creativity. They like to travel and find the art through photography. 
        These people like landscape, travel, and daily life images. Lifestyle photography that inspires them to travel the world or looking for ideas where to go. People who is looking that emotional feeling that images bring.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p> About is going to explain a little about who I am and why I decided to do this website. Specially why about these topics. For example;</p>
      <p>Paragraph Topic</p>

      <p>“I am a mom of three little girls, Argentine, photographer, artist and a student of Web Design and Development. I love to capture images with meaning, natural views, 
          and the surroundings of every place where I travel or in my own space! I only highlight the real beauty of these photos because I want you to feel the reality of inspiring moments. 
          This helps people to ponder about life, the world and the art that surrounds us in the most realistic way.”
      </p>

      <p> A little bit of me. 
          I’m from Argentina, I am married, and my husband is from the States. We have three little girls and a one-year-old puppy call Thor. It’s a yorkie (the name looks cute on him).
          I am a photographer, artist and student of Web design and Development. I love to take pictures and specially if they bring memories and if it has meaning. 
          My family and I are living on Italy for a few years so while we are here, we travel the most that we can. It is a dream come true.”

      </ul>
      <h3>Photography Blog</h3>
      <p>
        My website is about photography but not a regular family photography site. My idea it’s about inspiring photography. It is a combination between a blog and my photography experience traveling, 
        being a mom, student, in general a daily life.
        I have always loved taking pictures, but I like the kind that inspires me and that can inspire people. That is why I decided to do the website about this kind of photography. 
        It will be simple and mostly daily life inspiring. That is my goal at least. 
      </p>
      <p>Paragraph Topic</p>
      <p>“Today, I was feeling a little overwhelm about everything in home and routine. While I was going back home, I felt the big desired to just drive my bike even if it only was a few minutes. 
          I felt inspired by music. That always help. I grabbed my bike, and I didn’t even know where I was going but for sure it brought me peace. Those little moments that you feel that you want to do something, 
          just do it! I know many of us has busy life, but it is also important to feel motivated to give the best of you in work, school, home, anywhere you are! Enjoy those minutes of spontaneity because 
          that it’s to live your life.”
      </p>

      <p>“Every time we moved, and we moved so many times. I’ve tried to decorate my new home in a way that can bring  me peace and inspiration. It always has been a huge motivation in a daily basis. 
          I started by creating some motivational quotes and use them as decoration where I can see them, or sometimes images that I just feel motivated me. I grabbed a couple of things that I like around the house and 
          concentrate in those spot that I spend most of the time. I highly recommend it. It really brings the best ideas or cheers while you are working or studying. Those moments are very important too. 
          If for some reason you can’t decorated it as you desire. I recommend you choose a spot in your home and decorated as you want. Those spaces bring us peace and motivation! To me was a big help 
          while studying, reading, or doing things that needs concentration. Find your cozy spot.”
