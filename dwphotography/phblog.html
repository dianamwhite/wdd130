                <h2>Your comfy spot</h2>
                <p>Every time we moved, and we moved so many times. I’ve tried to decorate my new home in a way that can bring me peace and inspiration. It always has been a huge motivation in a daily basis. I started by creating some motivational quotes and use them as decoration where I can see them, or sometimes images that I just feel motivated me. I grabbed a couple of things that I like around the house and concentrate in those spot that I spend most of the time. I highly recommend it. It really brings the best ideas or cheers while you are working or studying. Those moments are very important too. If for some reason you can’t decorated it as you desire. I recommend you choose a spot in your home and decorated as you want. Those spaces bring us peace and motivation! To me was a big help while studying, reading, or doing things that needs concentration. Find your cozy spot.</p>

                <h2>Take a break</h2>
                <p>Today, I was feeling a little overwhelm about everything in home and routine. While I was going back home, I felt the big desired to just drive my bike even if it only was a few minutes. I felt inspired by music. That always help. I grabbed my bike, and I didn’t even know where I was going but for sure it brought me peace. Those little moments that you feel that you want to do something, just do it! I know many of us has busy life, but it is also important to feel motivated to give the best of you in work, school, home, anywhere you are! Enjoy those minutes of spontaneity because that it’s to live your life</p>
