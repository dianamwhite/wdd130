    <h2>Diana White</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone! I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've been member of the Church since I was 16. I served a
        Mission in Chile 2009-2010. I'm married and I have three beautiful daughters (9,
        7, 3) and a one year old puppy.
        I'm a photographer and I love to travel with my family. We live currently in Italy for work.
        I love art, read, draw, crochet everything that is related with art. My Major is in Web Design & Development. I
        am excited about this class and I hope I can learn what I need with all of you!
    </p>
